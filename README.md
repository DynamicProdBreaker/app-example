# App

Welcome to App, a typescript/javascript project natively installable on most platforms for the
collection and display of weather data!

This was developed as a template GitHub project, to demonstrate version control for newcomers to
Git, as well as introduce many of it's concepts for better understanding of the tool.

This application was developed using Node.js and written with Angular.

Development on this project will require Angular and the [Angular CLI, version 13.3.6](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli), as well as Node.js, available from the command line.

## Running a development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## How to build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
